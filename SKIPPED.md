# Skipped days — ongoing media-rights blocker

The blocker below still stops every **Reel** day (Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri/Sun). It does
**not** stop Wed/Sat, which are Carousels: PIPELINE.md §3 option 3 allows licensed
stock on a non-venue-specific editorial Carousel. Each entry below records one
skipped run. Stopped under PIPELINE.md §0 ("If rights ... cannot be verified,
stop without adding a queue item").

## 2026-09-16 (Wed), carousel / cafe — PUBLISHED TO QUEUE, not skipped

First run to take the Wed/Sat escape hatch the 2026-09-15 entry identified. Queued
`2026-09-16-korea-cup-rules-en`, a non-venue-specific editorial Carousel on Korea's
September 2026 reusable-cup pact. Names no venue as its subject, so §2's venue
checks do not apply and §3 option 3 is available.

Cover photo is CC0 1.0 (public domain) from Wikimedia Commons, licence verified
programmatically via the Commons API (`LicenseShortName: CC0`, `Restrictions:`
empty) rather than assumed — see `rights_note` in the content JSON. This is the
first file in `content/` to actually carry policy-v2 metadata
(`policy_version`/`asset_source`/`rights_confirmed`/`rights_note`), so it is also
the first that `publish.py:validate_rights()` checks rather than waves through.

**Still open for a human:** the account remains action-blocked. Everything from
2026-08-30 on is `held`; the last successful publish was 2026-08-30, and
2026-09-13 was held with subcode 2207051. This item is queued `pending` for 18:30
KST, so tonight's 19:00 publisher will attempt it. If the block is still live it
will fail and be set to `held` — that is PIPELINE.md §6's designed behaviour, not
a new fault. No ramp flag is set anywhere in `queue.json` or repo notes, so §1's
ramp imposed no constraint on this run.

**Rendering note for future runs:** `cardnews.py`'s `fit()` silently overflows
when text exceeds a box at its minimum font size — it does not raise. The first
render of this post ran off the canvas on the `point` slide and collided the
`source` list with the CTA box, and exited 0 both times. Renders must be looked
at, not just exit-code checked.

## 2026-09-15 (Tue), reel / local — SKIPPED

Second consecutive skip. No content JSON, no rendered output, no change to
`queue.json`.

The media blocker from 2026-09-14 is unchanged and remains decisive. The ffmpeg
blocker is **resolved** — see below.

### Still blocking: no compliant media for a venue-specific Reel

PIPELINE.md §3 allows, in order: (1) original media from the account owner,
(2) venue/creator media with written permission, (3) licensed stock **only for a
non-venue-specific editorial Carousel**. CONTENT.md agrees: "Venue-specific Reels
and Collabs must use original or written partner-authorized media."

Tuesday is reel + local food + Collab candidate. In this environment:

- no owner-supplied original media exists. Every file in `assets/photos/` was
  fetched by a previous pipeline run; the only human-added one
  (`cheongildip-en.jpg`, 392aefd) predates the new policy. Nothing has been added
  since the policy change;
- written venue permission cannot be obtained by an unattended run;
- licensed stock is available and legal, but §3 forbids it for this format.

Note the constraint binds on **format**, not only on venue-specificity. Even a
dish-focused editorial angle (e.g. chungmu gimbap as a dish rather than one
restaurant) cannot use stock, because §3 option 3 permits stock only for a
Carousel. Tuesday is a Reel, so that escape hatch is closed.

**This blocks every future run except Wed/Sat.** Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri/Sun are all
Reels. Only Wed/Sat (Carousel) can proceed, and only on a non-venue-specific
editorial topic.

To unblock, one of:

- drop original photos into `assets/photos/` for the venues to be covered;
- restore a stock allowance for Reels in PIPELINE.md §3 (with the "never presented
  as the actual venue" disclaimer the old posts used);
- move the venue-specific days to Carousel and keep Reels for editorial topics.

This is an editorial/policy decision, so an unattended run will not make it.

### Two corrections to the 2026-09-14 entry

1. **ffmpeg is installable and the Reel path works.** `sudo apt-get install -y
   ffmpeg` succeeds on the runner. With it installed, `scripts/reel.py` produced a
   valid 1080×1920, 22.2s MP4 from existing content with no errors. So this is a
   missing dependency, not a broken script.

   **A human must apply the fix** — this run could not. Pushing a change to
   `.github/workflows/` is rejected: `refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or
   update workflow .github/workflows/daily-content.yml without 'workflows'
   permission`. `daily-content.yml` grants only `contents: write` and
   `id-token: write`. Either add `workflows: write` to that block, or commit this
   step by hand after `pillow 설치`:

   ```yaml
   - name: ffmpeg 설치
     run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
   ```

   As documented, cloud-built Reels use ffmpeg-synthesized audio, because
   `assets/music/*.mp3` is gitignored (`! local: tracks.json 에 등록됐지만 파일이
   없습니다`).

2. **No content file has `rights_note`.** The previous entry said `rights_note`
   values in `content/` read "licensed free-use stock, not <venue> itself". Those
   strings are real but they live in the **sources slide** text, not in a rights
   field. In fact **zero** of the 40 files in `content/` carry `policy_version`,
   `asset_source`, `rights_confirmed` or `rights_note` — policy v2 metadata is
   entirely unimplemented in existing content, and `cardnews.py` does not read it.

### Related gap: publish.py is more permissive than PIPELINE.md

`validate_rights()` (scripts/publish.py:78) skips all rights checks when
`policy_version < 2`, which is every existing file. For v2 content it accepts
`asset_source` in `{original, partner_licensed, licensed_stock}` **regardless of
format** — it does not encode §3's "stock only for a non-venue-specific editorial
Carousel" rule. A stock-photo Reel would therefore pass the publisher while
violating PIPELINE.md. Worth closing if §3 is meant to be enforced in code.

### Also worth a human decision: the account is still action-blocked

`2026-09-13-terarosa-gangneung-en` was held on 2026-09-14 with
`instagram_action_blocked` (OAuthException code 4, subcode 2207051). Everything
from 2026-08-30 onward is `held`; the last successful publish was 2026-08-30.

CONTENT.md says the workflow "stays disabled until a human confirms that Account
Status is clear" and that recovery ramps 3 posts in week 1, 4 in week 2. No ramp
flag is set anywhere in `queue.json` or repo notes, though PIPELINE.md §1 says to
respect one. Queuing new items now would feed the 19:00 KST publisher into an
actively blocked account.

### Verified working this run

- `TZ=Asia/Seoul date` → 2026-09-15 Tuesday → reel / local (§1).
- No same-day `pending`/`published` queue item (§0).
- WebSearch works. WebFetch works on koreaherald.com; namu.wiki returns HTTP 403.
- `scripts/cardnews.py` renders 7 slides at 1080×1350 with no errors.
- `scripts/reel.py` renders 1080×1920 MP4 once ffmpeg is present.

## 2026-09-14 (Mon), reel / restaurant — SKIPPED

First run to execute the policy rewrite in 8128750 (2026-09-14 10:12 KST).
Stopped for two reasons: no compliant media for a venue-specific Reel (unchanged,
see above), and `ffmpeg` missing from the runner (since fixed).

The previous PIPELINE.md §4 explicitly permitted mood-matched Unsplash stock and
said the photo "does not need to be the literal venue's own interior". 8128750
removed that allowance. Every existing post relies on it — under the new rules
none of them would be publishable as Reels.
